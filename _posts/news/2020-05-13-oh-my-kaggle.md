Well. I searched for data to get additional information to the data I already have. Kaggle's datasets are countless. The tabs in my browser are cumulative when reading the community and the different challenges. 
I find the datasets :  
- WDIData : some development indicators from internatopnal sources.
- Education Statistics: a collection of indicators that describe education access.
- 20 years US University Dataset : contains information about universities of United State.
- USA Airport Dataset: some informations about USA flights 
- US_Perm_Visa: informations about the job of a foreign worker
- Airline Delay and Cancellation Data: more data about flights

I limit the loading of files to 1000 lines while exploring with Python.

I read "La Logique pas a pas"(Logic step by step) by Jacques Duparc, The theory of sets more specifically. I love that book! 
I learn about `df.read_` to load files. 
 
Tomorrow, I will work about data clean... or not!     
So, step by step!
