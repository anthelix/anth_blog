Well. Finally got around to putting this website. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.  
Thanks to [jonathan Mcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#) and his howdodo.
