Well.   
Introduction to the Object-oriented programming (OOP)! This is a topic that could take a whole week. In the programming history, we have 4 generations: Binary Programming, Assembly Language, Procedural Programming then OOP. Everything is an object with Java and java supports the following concepts: Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Classes, Objects, Instance, Method, Message Passing.
### Classes
`class` can be compare to a template or blueprint( I love this word) and `object` is create from the class. Inside class, `attributs` and `methods`.  

Definition : `modifier class NameClass{ attributs + methods }`
Declaration : 



Methods tips:
- block of code to re-use
- **calling** or **invoking** the method
- Syntax : Name, Parameters, Method body, Return type
- Methods vs Functions:
    - A function is any block of reusable/callable code
    - A method is a block of reusable/callable code **that is attached to a class or object**
    
 ```java
public class MethodExercise{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("The Sum is:" + MethodExercise.addNumbers(7,7));
	}
	
	
	//Add your function here:
	public static int addNumbers(int num1, int num2){
			return num1 + num2;
	}
}
```
