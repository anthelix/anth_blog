 The quality of data is directly related to accurate insights and better decision-making.  
 Applications and business processes need combined data from multiple separate business systems into a single unified view. In order to provide consistent access and delivery data across subjects and structure types, this view is typically stored in a central data integration, DataWarehouse and  is often a prerequisite to other processes including analysis, reporting, and forecasting. 
 
 To allow organizations to make better choices based on deeper understanding of their business data, there are a few data integration techniques: 
- **Extract, Transform and Load** : data is copied from different sources, merged, reconciled and load into DWh. 
-  **Extract, Load and Transform** : data is loaded into a big data system and transformed later for a particular analytics  uses.
- **Change Data Capture** : follow data changs in real-time and applies them to a Dwh. 
- **Data Replication** : some  data from  is replicted to other databases to keep the information synchronized to operational uses and for backup.
- **Streaming Data Integration** : a real time data integration method. Different streams of data are continuously integrated and fed into analytics systems and data stores. 

###### Benefits:
Data sources are most of the time disparate and stored into silo. Data Integration is useful for 
- Data integrity and data quality
- Information transfer between systems
- Fast and easily accessible connections between data stores.
- Increased efficiency and ROI
- Complete view of business intelligence, insights, and analytics
