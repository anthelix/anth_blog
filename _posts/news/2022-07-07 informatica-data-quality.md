The ability of data characteristics to meet the internal (management, decision making) and external requirements (regulations) of an organization is Data Quality(DQ). 
Data Quality management is done through 3 areas,
- Data Governance
  . to supervise the quality, the updating, the procedures set up to maintain the data quality
  . to define the key objectives of the company and how to achieve them
  . to focus on the data that is important for the company and the goals and to delete the irrelevant data
  . educate co-workers about DQ
- Data Quality Assurance
  . verifie what's wrong in data( inaccurate, inconsistent, incomplete data), check what is wrong and make a plan to anticipate its failures and propose patches to guaranteeing data quality over time.
  . enables the achievement of the objectives identified by the data governance.
 - Data Quality Control
  . make sure the data is accurate and does not contain unneeded data.
  . controls both the quality of the data and its use by the company's stakeholders.
  . decides if the data is useful, relevant, worth exploiting.
