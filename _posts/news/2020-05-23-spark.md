Well. 
I finished the exploration part with Python, finished the dictionaries and switched to another Jupyter Notebook to start working with Spark. 
It's been a hard day running Docker Spark and Jupyter. Error messages in Java are not easy to understand. Luckily Stackoverflow is here!
Today, finally a container running, with Spark, Jupyter Notebook and a postgres database. 

I learn to read the logs...
I read lot of logs and my code...
