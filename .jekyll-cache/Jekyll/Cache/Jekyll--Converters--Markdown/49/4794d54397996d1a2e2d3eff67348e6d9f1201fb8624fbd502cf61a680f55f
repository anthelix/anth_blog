I"á<p>Well. I searched for data to get additional information to the data I already have. Kaggleâ€™s datasets are countless. The tabs in my browser are cumulative when reading the community and the different challenges. 
I find the datasets :</p>
<ul>
  <li>WDIData : some development indicators from internatopnal sources.</li>
  <li>Education Statistics: a collection of indicators that describe education access.</li>
  <li>20 years US University Dataset : contains information about universities of United State.</li>
  <li>USA Airport Dataset: some informations about USA flights</li>
  <li>US_Perm_Visa: informations about the job of a foreign worker</li>
  <li>Airline Delay and Cancellation Data: more data about flights</li>
</ul>
