I"P<p>Well. Finally got around to putting this website. Neat thing about it - powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Thanks to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#">jonathan Mcglone</a> and his howdodo</p>
