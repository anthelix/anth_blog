<p>Well. Today, I worked around my datasets. I would like to add datasets to my project. One in particular caught my attention: the <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/">GDLT project</a>. It is a database of all the events around the world found in the news. The database is in a bucket of aws s3 and it’s gigantic! I first tried to explore it with Spark and Docker. One mistake, which I couldn’t solve all day: “No FileSystem for scheme: s3”. There were some serious leads, I couldn’t find any solution… for the moment. The days are passing and the dateline is getting closer. Another way, “boto3” works but doesn’t work locally on my laptop. 
Tomorrow I’ll find a smaller dataset.</p>
